### REST Client requests for Library app

# 1) Create book (JSON API) - POST /api/books
# Note: ensure the API router is mounted in app.js (app.use('/api', apiRouter)) and that /routes/api.js exists.
# Replace <authorId> with a real author _id from your MongoDB
POST http://localhost:3000/api/books
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "REST Client Book",
  "author": "<authorId>",
  "summary": "Created via REST Client",
  "isbn": "REST-123456"
}

###

# 2) Create book (form submit) - POST /catalog/book/create
# Simulates the HTML form submit (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
POST http://localhost:3000/catalog/book/create
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

title=REST+Form+Book&author=<authorId>&summary=Form+submission&isbn=FORM-987654

###

# 3) Get list of books (HTML)
GET http://localhost:3000/catalog/books

###

# 4) (Optional) Get book detail - replace <bookId>
GET http://localhost:3000/catalog/book/<bookId>

# Usage notes:
# - Start the server with `npm start` or `npm run devstart`.
# - Use the VS Code REST Client extension to run these requests directly from this file (click "Send Request").
# - If the JSON API request returns 404, check that `routes/api.js` exists and `app.js` mounts it with `app.use('/api', apiRouter)`.
